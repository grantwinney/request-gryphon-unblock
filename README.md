# Request Gryphon Unblock - a browser extension

If you're using the [Gryphon router](https://gryphonconnect.com/) and a site is blocked, click the icon to submit a request for access.

- This has the same effect as visiting http://gryphoncare.com to request access.
- Like visiting the GryphonCare site, you have to be on the same network protected by the Gryphon router.
